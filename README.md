# Fox Blog

Fox Blog is my first venture into learning React. This project was created following Net Ninja's [Full Modern React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d). Thereby, no original designs from me for the site itself. The only original content is anything involving Docker.

## To run

Make sure you have Docker installed, then enter the folder and run:
`docker compose up --build`

The page will then be available to access on http://localhost:8080
